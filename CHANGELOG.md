#### Data Types
- Numbers (integers and floating-point)
- Strings with concatenation support
- Booleans with logical operations
- Arrays with dynamic sizing and indexing
- Null/nil values

#### Built-in Functions
- **Output**: `print()` for value display
- **Type System**: `type()`, `str()`, `num()`, `int()`, `bool()`
- **Math**: `abs()`, `sqrt()`, `max()`, `min()`, `floor()`, `ceil()`, `pow()`, `mod()`
- **Arrays**: `len()` for array length

- **File I/O**: `read_file()`, `write_file()`, `append_file()`
- **JSON**: `json_parse()`, `json_stringify()`
- **Cryptography**: `sha256()` for secure hashing

#### Security Features
- Comprehensive input validation
- Memory safety protections
