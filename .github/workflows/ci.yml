# All advanced testing, packaging, and release functionality has been
# disabled until the core build issues are resolved. This includes:
# - Memory safety testing with ASAN/Valgrind
# - Performance benchmarking  
# - Multi-compiler builds
# - Integration testing
# - Package building (DEB/RPM)
# - Release automation
#
# These will be re-enabled once the basic build is stable.
